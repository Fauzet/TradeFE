					Hello, in this friendly guide i'm going to show you how easy it is to actually start trading
					on FauzetTrade platform. But first, let me introduce you what FauzetTrade actually is. The
					main foundation of why our team build FauzetTrade is because we want to serve our users
					much better experience with high sustainability. So instead of burning money right away, we
					used an advanced financial model which should be used by baby startups. We aim to be the best
					serving virtual cryptocurrency exchange available, eliminating the cost for you to transact
					and minding about legal documents.

					Wooh, that's so many. We even be friendly to interns and under 18 traders. So, do you
					have what it takes to be the #1 trader?
					</p>
					<h3>How To Begin</h3>
					<p>
					So you came up to the homepage and see the intesertingly white button, you clicked on
					it. Suddenly you're redirected to a page greeting you with a login form. You did not
					know where is the registration button, it is just a form with two inputs. Here is the
					explanation, our platform did not complicate you with the 'ol registration form. We
					are not curious with your phone numbers and addresses. When you submit the form, it
					will automatically check if the combination of username and password exists in our
					database, if yes, then it will log you into your account. Otherwise, it will create
					one for you and you get logged in.
					</p>
					<p>
					Next, you'll be depositing your asset into your account. To do this, you can click
					the deposit tab on your sidebar (as shown below)
					</p>
					<img src="/imgs/guide/deposit_button.png"></img>
					<p>
					Then, you need a FaucetPay account. I'm not gonna expand what FaucetPay is, but
					FaucetPay is one of the largest microwallet service, bridging more than thousands
					of faucet worldwide. If you don't have an account, you can make one
					<a href="https://faucetpay.io/?r=28776">here</a>
					</p>
					<p>
					After finished the registration on FaucetPay, you can deposit some coins to there
					and go back to our deposit page. First, you need to select your desired cryptocurrency
					to deposit. Secondly, put the amount you want to deposit. Finally, click "Deposit".
					</p>
					<img src="/imgs/guide/deposit_form.png"></img>
					<p>
					Actually, there is one more input we haven't discussed. The "Deposit With" input.
					This input field is one shortcut for you to deposit one currency and receive
					other currency without the need to exchange them and pay trading fee. We call
					this "Swap Deposit". When you select one currency on it, you'll be charged with
					that specific cryptocurrency instead of the target currency (the first input)
					</p>
					<p>
					So there you go, you just finished the short guide on how to begin on FauzetTrade.
					Shall we begin the next quest?
					</p>
